      <h4>title:Safety Management system through smart poles </h4>
<p>This proposal addresses the rising crime rates in India, particularly crimes against women, by introducing 
safety management system through smart poles. These systems feature emergency button linked to police 
control rooms via GSM networks and microprocessors. Integrated with cameras, GPS, and microcontrollers, 
they enable rapid reporting of crimes and quick response from law enforcement</p>
<h4>title:Lossless Image Compression Using Matlab </h4>
<p>This process involves the elimination of various types of redundancies, such as coding redundancy, spatial 
redundancy, and irrelevant information, ultimately leading to efficient data storage and transmission</p>
